# gkit Architecture

## Purpose

A collection of small CLI utilities written in Go.

## System Summary

Document the system's major components, boundaries, runtime flow, storage model, and external integrations here.

## Current Platform

- Go

## Major Components

- entrypoints and user-facing surfaces
- core domain or business logic
- storage, messaging, or state boundaries
- external integrations and trust boundaries
- `repoctl`: consolidated local Git repository management through `git` and scoped GitHub operations through `gh`
- `oidctok`: GitHub Actions job helper that fetches the job's OIDC token and exchanges it at the Microsoft identity platform for Resource Manager and Graph tokens over HTTPS with the standard library only; it keeps no local state and writes tokens only to the `GITHUB_ENV` file
- `attune`: declarative reconciler comparing YAML specs against live Azure Resource Manager and Microsoft Graph state (DNS, security groups, app registrations, roles, resource groups); the repo's first utility with live, state-mutating external-integration calls

## Core Files

- `AGENTS.md`: base governance contract
- `plan.md`: prioritized roadmap and approved direction
- `build.sh`: self-contained build, release-prep, and release tooling
- `governa/development-cycle.md`: workflow from roadmap through release
- `governa/ac-template.md`: acceptance-criteria template for new work
- `governa/build-release.md`: build, test, and release rules

## Data And Control Flow

Describe the main request, job, or publish path from entrypoint to output.

## Architecture Notes

- record stable system decisions here
- prefer durable structure and interfaces over transient implementation detail
- `internal/numfmt` is the single thousands-separator implementation; utilities that print large counts call it instead of keeping a local copy. `internal/vedit` is the shared ffmpeg/ffprobe driver behind `vkeep`, `vdrop`, `vconv`, and `vshrink`.
- `cash5` operates on the 1-45 era only. Draws with `DrawTime` before `cash5EraStartMillis` (2014-09-14 UTC, the first 1-45 pool draw) are pruned at load and the local `draws.json` is rewritten in place; pre-cutoff history is not retained. Recommendation generation enforces a uniqueness invariant against the post-cutoff winners set.
- `attune` authenticates via the local `az` CLI (`az account show`/`az account get-access-token`), never its own credential store; it writes no local state, cache, or telemetry — the live provider is the only source of truth. Requests are restricted to an ARM/Graph origin allowlist, and non-2xx response bodies are redacted wholesale before reaching any diagnostic or error message, so a failure can never leak provider response content. Role-assignment/definition resource IDs are derived deterministically (SHA1-based, RFC4122 URL-namespace UUIDv5) to stay stable across repeated `apply` runs and compatible with resources rkit's `attune` already created live.

## Conventions

- update this document when architecture or major workflow changes materially
- keep implementation detail in code and stable architecture here
