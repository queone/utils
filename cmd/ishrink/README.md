## ishrink
Re-encode a HEIC, JPEG, or JPG image as a small JPEG via macOS `sips`.

### Why?
A phone photo is several megabytes, far more than a chat message or a web form wants. `ishrink` re-encodes one image as JPEG at 10% quality, names the output with today's date, and prints the before/after sizes.

```bash
ishrink IMG_4821.heic
==> Shrinking IMG_4821.heic
FILE    NAME                      SIZE
input   IMG_4821.heic          3,412,908
output  IMG_4821_20260908a.jpg   188,211
```

### Usage

```bash
ishrink [flags] INPUT
```

`INPUT` is a `.heic`, `.jpeg`, or `.jpg` file, in any letter case. The output is the input's stem plus `_YYYYMMDDa.jpg`, written next to it. `ishrink` refuses to overwrite an existing file.

### Quality
10% JPEG quality is the setting the retired `resize_image.sh` script used. It is meant for sharing, not archiving; the original is left untouched.

### Requirements
`sips` ships with macOS, so `ishrink` runs only on a Mac and needs nothing installed.
