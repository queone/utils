## oidctok
Exchange a GitHub Actions OIDC token for Azure Resource Manager and Microsoft Graph tokens and hand them to later job steps.

### Why?
A workflow that manages Azure should not carry a client secret. With a federated credential on the app registration, GitHub's OIDC token proves which repository and branch is running, and the Microsoft identity platform trades it for real access tokens. `oidctok` does that exchange in one static binary: no Python, no `pip install`, no Azure CLI login.

```
==> ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_TOKEN hint = eyJ0******
==> ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL = https://pipelinesghubeus2.actions.githubusercontent.com/...
==> OIDC token hint = eyJh******
==> Decoded OIDC token claims:
    aud: api://AzureADTokenExchange
    exp: 2026-Sep-09 06:40 UTC (1757400000)
    iss: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
    sub: repo:org/repo:ref:refs/heads/main
    ...
==> AZ_TOKEN hint = eyJ0******
==> MG_TOKEN hint = eyJ0******
```

### Usage

```bash
oidctok [flags]
```

Flags: `-a, --audience AUD` overrides the audience requested from GitHub (default `api://AzureADTokenExchange`, which is what an Azure federated credential expects). `-v, --version` and `-h, --help` behave as usual.

### In a workflow
The job needs `permissions: id-token: write`, plus `CLIENT_ID` and `TENANT_ID` for the app registration:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read
steps:
  - run: go install github.com/queone/gkit/cmd/oidctok@latest
  - run: oidctok
    env:
      CLIENT_ID: ${{ vars.CLIENT_ID }}
      TENANT_ID: ${{ vars.TENANT_ID }}
  - run: curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $AZ_TOKEN" https://management.azure.com/subscriptions?api-version=2022-12-01
```

`oidctok` appends `AZ_TOKEN=...` and `MG_TOKEN=...` to the file named by `GITHUB_ENV`, so every later step sees them as environment variables.

### What it prints and what it never prints
Only the first four characters of any token appear in the log, followed by asterisks. The decoded claims of the OIDC token are printed in full because they carry no secret; `aud`, `iss`, and `sub` are the three that must match the federated credential. Every endpoint must be HTTPS, and a failed token response is reported with its error description cut at 512 bytes.

### Python option
`scripts/get_oidc_tokens.py` does the same exchange with the `requests` and `msal` packages, for a job whose runtime is already Python. The Go binary is recommended for simplicity and speed.
