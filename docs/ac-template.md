Copy this file to `docs/ac<N>-<slug>.md`, where `N` is the next sequential AC number and `slug` is a kebab-case identifier. Set the file's heading to `# AC<N> Title`.

The AC is the implementation contract for one approved roadmap item. The full development cycle that wraps around this template lives in `docs/development-cycle.md`. The enforceable rules around when to draft, review, and integrate an AC live in `AGENTS.md`.

# AC<N> Title

One-paragraph summary of what this AC delivers and why. State the change in plain terms — feature, refactor, infrastructure, or doc. Note whether it is code or doc-only.

## Summary

Describe the change in one short paragraph.

## Objective Fit

1. **Which part of the primary objective?** Tie the work to a concrete part of the product or platform objective. If you cannot answer this in one sentence, the AC is probably not ready.
2. **Why not advance a higher-priority task instead?** Either name the higher-priority blocker that this unblocks, or label the work as an intentional pivot and explain the trade-off.
3. **What existing decision does it depend on or risk contradicting?** Reference the prior AC, architectural decision, or shipped feature that this builds on. If it contradicts a prior decision, say so explicitly and explain why the contradiction is intentional.
4. **Intentional pivot?** If yes, state that here and reaffirm point 2.

## In Scope

List the concrete changes this AC will make. Use sub-headings for grouping (e.g. "New files", "Modified files", "Schema changes"). Be specific — file paths, function names, table columns. The In Scope list is the authoritative scope contract.

### New files

- `path/to/new_file` — what it contains
- `docs/new-doc.md` — what it documents

### Modified files

- `existing_file` — what changes
- `arch.md` — what gets updated

### Schema changes

(If any. Include the new schema version and the migration step.)

## Out Of Scope

List things the AC explicitly does **not** do. This is as important as the In Scope list — it bounds the change and prevents scope creep during implementation.

- Things deferred to a later AC (link the deferral)
- Adjacent improvements that would be tempting but are not required
- Things that look in scope but aren't (called out to prevent confusion)

## Implementation Notes

(Optional but encouraged.) Notes on approach, gotchas, edge cases, or design decisions that the implementer needs to know but that don't belong in the spec proper. If a particular approach was already considered and rejected, capture it here.

## Acceptance Tests

Every AT must be labeled `[Automated]` or `[Manual]` (see `docs/build-release.md` for the labeling convention).

**AT1** [Automated] — One-line description of what is verified, with the exact check (file existence, grep pattern, SQL query, or CLI output).

**AT2** [Automated] — ...

**AT3** [Manual] — One-line description plus the live action the user must take to confirm the result.

## Documentation Updates

List the docs that must be updated as part of this AC. If a change touches code that has corresponding documentation, update those docs in the same pass.

- `arch.md` — what section
- `README.md` — what section
- `CHANGELOG.md` — added at release prep time, not during implementation

## Status

`PENDING` — awaiting user authorization to begin implementation.

(Other valid states: `IN PROGRESS`, `DEFERRED` (with reason and tracking ref). For partial completion, list status by phase. Completed ACs are deleted at release time per the development cycle — do not change status to DONE before deletion.)
