# Build and Release

Reference for this repo's build pipeline, pre-release checklist, and acceptance test conventions. The enforceable one-liners live in `AGENTS.md`; this document explains the pipeline, the steps, and the rationale.

## Build

This repo has a single canonical build/test workflow: `./build.sh`.

`./build.sh` is a thin Bash dispatcher. The real implementation lives in `go run ./cmd/build` (build/test) and `go run ./cmd/rel` (release). Both `cmd/build` and `cmd/rel` are `go run` entrypoints — they are intentionally not installed as binaries.

The build pipeline runs these steps in order, fail-hard on each:

1. `go mod tidy` — ensure `go.mod` and `go.sum` are consistent
2. `go fmt ./...` — **fail-hard.** If `go fmt` rewrote any file (non-empty stdout), the build fails. Re-run after committing the formatting fix.
3. `go fix ./...` — advisory; output is logged but does not break the build
4. `go vet ./...` — **fail-hard**
5. Test suite with coverage — fail-hard on any test failure
6. `staticcheck ./...` — **fail-hard.** Installed on first run via `go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@latest` if not already on `PATH`; subsequent runs reuse the existing install.
7. Binary build — installs utilities to `$GOPATH/bin`

Invoking individual Go tools directly skips the tidy/fmt/lint pipeline above. A "passing" direct invocation can still produce a build that `./build.sh` would reject. The wrapper guarantees that what passes locally is what would pass in CI.

## Acceptance Tests

This repo uses a labeled-AT convention adopted with the AC-first workflow. Every AT in an AC document must be labeled `[Automated]` or `[Manual]`.

- **Automated** — The result can be verified from CLI output, test assertions, or file inspection. Automated ATs are run during implementation and re-run as part of the pre-release checklist.
- **Manual** — Requires a live end-to-end action and must be confirmed by the user. The agent cannot self-verify these.

Default to Automated whenever the result is verifiable without a live external service. Manual ATs add friction to the release flow, so reserve them for behaviors that genuinely cannot be checked any other way.

## Pre-Release Checklist

Do not begin this checklist until the user explicitly asks to prep for release or equivalent. This is gated by the release-prep trigger rule in `AGENTS.md` (Release Or Publish Triggers).

1. **Check the latest git tag and working tree.** Run `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1` and `git status`. If the tree is clean and the latest tag matches the `programVersion` constant in the main binary source, there is nothing to release — do not proceed. Never assume the current version from build output or prior conversation; always verify from git.
2. **Run `./build.sh`.** Fix all failures until the build is clean.
3. **Ask the user whether the live ATs were run.** Manual ATs cannot be verified from CLI output and require explicit confirmation.
4. **Audit `arch.md` against the code.** Verify affected reference docs are current.
5. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`.** The file is a `# Changelog` heading followed by a 2-column markdown table (`| Version | Summary |`). Move the current `Unreleased` summary into a new row for the release version directly below `Unreleased`, then restore an empty `Unreleased` row. Summaries are single-line, ≤ 500 characters, and should lead with the AC reference if any. Versions are unprefixed (`0.29.0`, not `v0.29.0`). Do not backfill historical tags or invent alternative shapes (Keep-a-Changelog, sectioned `## vX.Y.Z`, etc.).

    Canonical shape:

    ```
    # Changelog

    | Version | Summary |
    |---------|---------|
    | Unreleased | |
    | 0.29.0 | AC47: <one-line summary> |
    ```

    Bootstrap: if `CHANGELOG.md` does not yet exist, create it with the header, the `Unreleased` row, and the new release row. No need to backfill historical versions.
6. **Bump version constants.** Use the tag from step 1 as the baseline.
7. **Remove completed features from `plan.md`.**
8. **Consolidate finished AC decisions into durable docs, then delete the AC file.** Do not delete AC files that are PENDING, IN PROGRESS, or DEFERRED — they are still active contracts. Only completed (released) ACs are deleted.
9. **Present the release command for the user to run.** The agent never runs the release command directly. The release message must be **≤ 80 characters** — `cmd/rel` enforces this and will reject longer messages. Count before presenting. Present only the command; do not add trailing commentary explaining what it does, how the wrapper routes, or what prompts will appear. The director already knows.

The release command (`./build.sh vX.Y.Z "message"`) executes `cmd/rel`, which orchestrates `git add → commit → tag → push tag → push branch` and produces recovery guidance if any step fails.

## Template Upgrade

This repo was generated from a governa governance template. To check for template updates:

1. Run `governa sync` to generate a review document with per-file recommendations. This also updates `TEMPLATE_VERSION` to the current template version.
2. Compare `TEMPLATE_VERSION` in this repo against the template's current version. `TEMPLATE_VERSION` reflects the last template version this repo was evaluated against, not the original bootstrap version.
3. `.governa-manifest`, if present, records SHA-256 checksums of each file at bootstrap time. This enables comparison to distinguish your customizations from stale template content.
4. **Produce a per-sync feedback artifact.** Every governa sync that produces an adoption AC must also produce a separate file at `docs/ac<N>-<slug>-feedback.md` capturing genuine observations about the sync output (template defaults that fight the repo, scoring gaps, methodology issues, things that landed well). The artifact is out-of-band — not folded into the sync AC's body — so the feedback exists independently of the adoption work. The director routes its content upstream to governa. The artifact is deleted at release prep alongside the AC. This codifies step 7 of the sync's Evaluation Methodology so it cannot be silently skipped.

Template refresh is operator-driven. The governa tool proposes; the repo maintainer decides what to adopt.

## Standing Divergences from Template

Durable record of explicit-keep decisions where this repo intentionally differs from the governa template. Each entry survives across AC deletions and gives future syncs a documented reason to leave the divergence in place.

- `README.md` — kept project-specific. Template scaffolding sections (`Overview`, `Core Repo Files`, `Working Agreement`, `Workflow Summary`, `Replace Me`) intentionally not adopted; the existing utility list, Quick Install, and Getting Started content already serves the same purpose. Decision: AC1.
- `docs/build-release.md` Pre-Release Checklist step 5 **bootstrap note** — repo addition below the canonical code block: *"Bootstrap: if `CHANGELOG.md` does not yet exist, create it with the header, the `Unreleased` row, and the new release row. No need to backfill historical versions."* The template's step 5 has a canonical-shape code block (restored in v0.31.0) but no bootstrap guidance; this repo retains the note because the bootstrap case is the one place an operator is most likely to invent an alternative shape. Decision: AC3.
- `AGENTS.md` Project Rules **README alphabetical rule** — repo addition: *"Adding a new utility: add its entry to the `README.md` utility list in alphabetical order."* The template v0.32.1 dropped this bullet from Project Rules; this repo retains it because the utility list in `README.md` is a real user-facing surface of this multi-binary repo, and alphabetical order is the convention contributors should follow. Decision: AC4.
