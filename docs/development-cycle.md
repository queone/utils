# Development Cycle

This repo uses an acceptance-criteria-first workflow.

## Required Artifacts

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `arch.md`
- `plan.md`
- `docs/`

## Cycle

1. **Choose the next approved item.** Origination is either (a) an `Ideas To Explore` entry promoted after the director rubric-clears it, or (b) director-originated work (governance, adoption, hotfix, refinement). ACs are the single execution surface — draft directly when authorized.
2. **Draft an acceptance-criteria doc.** Start from `docs/ac-template.md` (see preamble for the monotonic-numbering rule); save as `docs/ac<N>-<slug>.md`.
3. **Review and tighten scope before implementation.** When QA files findings on the AC, DEV responds in the conversation with proposed changes or explicit disagreement, but does not edit the AC file until QA replies and the director confirms the iteration is closed. Repeat until the AC is implementation-ready. See `docs/critique-protocol.md` for the full critique-round protocol (round-append structure, terminator shape, and DEV/QA cross-references).
4. **Implement code, tests, and direct doc updates together.**
5. **Capture decisions in durable docs or code when the AC is complete.** The AC file is removed during release prep (see `docs/build-release.md` Pre-Release Checklist).
6. **Run the build and validation flow.** See `docs/build-release.md`.
7. **Perform release work only when explicitly requested.**

## Notes

- keep roadmap decisions in `plan.md`
- keep architecture changes in `arch.md`
- keep repo-level governance in `AGENTS.md`
- record follow-on ideas in `plan.md` under `Ideas To Explore` with an `IE<N>:` prefix (pre-rubric idea or pointer to a drafted AC stub)
- remove IE entries when the underlying idea is closed — rejected, retired, or (for AC pointers) the pointed-to AC has shipped
- write AC docs to file (`docs/ac<N>-<slug>.md`); summarize in the response but do not dump full AC content into conversation
- promotion path: shape (a) IE → discussion → objective-fit rubric (see `AGENTS.md` Approval Boundaries) → AC drafted (IE converts to shape (b) pointer, same `IE<N>` number) → AC ships (IE removed)
- stub ACs — ACs that carry `TBD — requires scoping before critique gate` in their Out Of Scope and Acceptance Tests sections until scoped — are permitted; flagged in Implementation Notes with `Rudimentary stub — requires further scoping before critique gate or implementation authorization.` and remain `PENDING` until a scoping pass runs and the critique gate activates
