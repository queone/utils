# utils
This is a collection of CLI utilities written in Go and usable on any OS that supports Go.

- The [`cmd/fr`](cmd/fr/README.md) utility: A simple find/replace utility.

## Why?
The Go language and its tool chain are an ideal way to maintain a commonly used set of CLI utilities because they can be quickly compiled to run on Windows, macOS, or Linux, thus providing a unified and portable solution to your scripting needs. With this setup, Go essentially turns into a package manager for these utilities.

## Getting Started
To get started with these utilities:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/queone/utils`
- Change into the repository directory: `cd utils`
- Build and **install** all the utilities: `./build`
- Try playing with each of the utilities 

## Releases
See [releases](releases.md) for the changelogs.
