# utils
Collection of CLI utilities written in Go.

- [`fr`](cmd/fr/README.md): A simple find/replace utility.
- [`tree`](cmd/tree/README.md): A lightweight directory tree printing utility.

## Why?
The Go language and its tool chain are an ideal way to maintain a commonly used set of CLI utilities because they can be quickly compiled and installed on Windows, macOS, or Linux that has Go installed. This provides a unified and portable solution to many a scripting needs. With this setup, Go essentially turns into a package manager for these utilities.

## Getting Started
To get started with these utilities:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/queone/utils`
- Change into the repository directory: `cd utils`
- Build and **install** all the utilities: `./build`
